# Packs: your own pieces, board and sounds

The extension shows Lichess's own board, pieces and sounds, the ones picked in
Lichess's settings. A pack replaces any of the three with yours: a folder on
GitHub holding a `pack.json` and the files it names.

To import one, open the user menu, then Board, Piece set or Sound, pick the
**Imported** tab, paste the link to the pack's folder and press **Import**.
The extension downloads every file once and keeps them in the browser; it
asks GitHub for nothing after that. An import shows every part the pack has,
from whichever panel; then each part is picked on its own: a pack's pieces
with Lichess's board, say. Lichess's own tab hands a part back to it.

The [example pack](../packs/example) uses every field. Copy it to start.

## The links that work

Any of these, to a public repository or a private one (see below):

| Link                                                                           | The pack's folder        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`                                            | the root, default branch |
| `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<branch>/<folder>`                     | `<folder>` on `<branch>` |
| `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/<folder>/pack.json`           | `<folder>` on `<branch>` |
| `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/<folder>/pack.json` | `<folder>` on `<branch>` |

`<branch>` may also be a tag or a commit, but not a branch with a `/` in its
name. Importing the same link again replaces the pack with its new files.

### A private repository

GitHub serves a private repository's files only with a token. Make a
[fine-grained token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)
for that repository alone, with **Contents: Read-only**, and paste it under
**Private repository?** before importing. The extension sends it to GitHub's
API for that import only and never keeps it; the pack's files are kept, so it
isn't needed again until you import the pack anew. The field is in Lichess's
page, like the rest of the menu: a token that can do nothing but read that
repository keeps the risk to that.

## pack.json

```json
{
  "name": "Warm wood",
  "pieces": "pieces/{piece}.svg",
  "board": { "image": "board.svg", "light": "#f2e4cc", "dark": "#c4936a" },
  "sounds": {
    "move-self": "sounds/move-self.wav",
    "capture": "sounds/capture.wav"
  }
}
```

| Field                       | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                      | The pack's name in the menu, 1 to 40 characters. Required.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `pieces`                    | The path of the twelve piece images, with `{piece}` for each one's name: `wK`, `wQ`, `wR`, `wB`, `wN`, `wP`, `bK` … `bP`, as Lichess names its own (a copy of a folder of lila's `public/piece` works as is). All twelve must be there. |
| `board.image`               | The board: one image of all 64 squares, white's side at the bottom, `a8` top left.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `board.light`, `board.dark` | The squares' colors, as `#rrggbb`, for the coordinates drawn on them. Optional, but both or neither: without them the coordinates keep Lichess's colors.                                                                                |
| `sounds`                    | Any of the sounds below, each a path. A sound the pack lacks is Lichess's.                                                                                                                                                              |

A pack needs at least one of `pieces`, `board` and `sounds` (with a sound in
it). Paths are relative to the folder of `pack.json` and can't leave it.

The sounds:

| Name            | Played on                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `move-self`     | your move, or a move on the side you play |
| `move-opponent` | the other side's move                     |
| `move-check`    | a move that gives check                   |
| `capture`       | a capture                                 |
| `castle`        | castling                                  |
| `promote`       | a promotion                               |
| `premove`       | a premove set                             |
| `illegal`       | a move the board refuses                  |
| `notify`        | a challenge, a message, a confirmation    |
| `tenseconds`    | low time                                  |
| `game-start`    | the start of a game                       |
| `game-end`      | the end of a game                         |

## Files

- **Images:** SVG, PNG, WebP, JPEG, GIF or AVIF. The pieces are drawn square,
  so give them a square canvas; 128px or more, or SVG, stays sharp.
- **Sounds:** MP3, Ogg or WAV, short.
- **Sizes:** `pack.json` up to 64 KB, each file up to 2 MB, the whole pack up
  to 16 MB.

The extension tells what a file is from its first bytes, not its name, and
turns down anything else. Each image must also draw: Lichess draws no board
at all when one of its pieces fails to.

## Licenses

Share only what you may share: your own work, or work whose license lets
you. Lichess lists its piece sets, boards and sounds with their licenses in
[lila's COPYING.md](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/blob/master/COPYING.md);
some are free to copy, others are not.
