# Game Review

On a game's analysis page, a summary of the game, then a move-by-move review
with a coach; on the free analysis board (`/analysis`), the same coach judging
each move as it's played. Lichess's analysis controller is reached through
`#page/lichess/analysis.ts`, a typed facade over `site.analysis`.

## The domain

What the review knows, judges and says, apart from what it shows. Everything
here is pure but the engine wrapper (`engine/stockfish.ts`), and none of it
reads the page: the UI passes in the game id, the coach, the language, the
opening's name and the page's asset URL.

| `rating/`     | The Game Rating: `model.json` (written by `tools/game-rating/fit.py`), Lichess's `divide`, `isTactical`, the odds, `rateGame`                                                      |
| `coach/`      | The coach's words: `remark`, `trajectory`, `fact`, `explanation`, seeded by `CoachContext`                                                                                         |
| `comment/`    | The comment's `[[…]]` tokens, `commentMarkup` (the typing's words at a given moment), `streamFor`, `verdictTitle`                                                                  |
| `i18n/`       | `ReviewLanguage`: every string, sentence and grammar rule, in `en` and `fr`; `pageLanguage()` picks one                                                                            |

## The main types

- `PositionRecord`: `{ cp | mate, whiteWinChance, secondLineWinChance, best }`,
  White's view; `toRecord` makes one from an `EngineResult` (the engine's, or
  `fromCloud`'s). The cache stores them under the original's short keys
  (`wp`, `wp2`): `StoredRecordCodec` reads and writes that format.
- `JudgeInput` → `judge` → `MoveVerdict`: the class (`moveClass`), the win
  probability lost (`loss`), `accuracy`, the engine's `best` / `bestSan`, both
  records, both positions and the opponent's `previousMove`. Judge a game's
  moves in order, each with the one before; to relink a move to a later-judged
  previous move, spread it (`{ ...move, previousMove }`): a review is
  immutable. The UI's `JudgedMove` (`session.ts`) is one that may also name
  its opening.
- `GameRatingInput` → `rateGame` → `GameRating`: per color, `{ elo, phases }`,
  or null for a player without a move.
- `CoachContext` (`gameId`, `coach`, `language`) → `explanation(move, context,
opening)` → `CommentPart[]`: sentences, the droppable one going when the
  bubble lacks room.
- `StreamState` (`key`, `shown`, `dropped`): the typing's progress, kept by
  the UI. `streamFor(state, parts)` starts it over for a new comment;
  `commentMarkup(parts, { stream, assets, language })` draws the words.

`variants.ts` names the variants the review judges. The game page's
game over (`src/page/game-over`) reuses the engine and `buildReview` for a
quick, uncached look at the player's moves, then runs the review's own
analysis there (`game-over/precompute.ts`), so the review opens complete.

## The UI

`index.ts` waits for the controller, `start.ts` wires the review up. One
`Session` (`session.ts`) holds what a page keeps: the view's state, the game's
analysis as it comes in (`GameWork`), the moves judged as they're played
(`LiveState`), the coach, the typing and the engines, which the game and the
moves played off it share (`engine-pool.ts`). Only `start.ts`, which builds the
session, calls the render directly; every other module goes through
`session.redraw` and `session.setMode`, which keeps the imports acyclic.

| Folder     | What it holds                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `game/`    | The game's analysis: its export (opening, server analysis), the cache, the cloud, the engine's queue (`nextJob`), and `buildReview`, which judges the moves whose positions are in and drafts the rest                      |
| `live/`    | Moves played on the board (the free board's, and those off a game): `judgeAt`, `bookAt`, `openingAt`, and the queue of engine and masters lookups (`pump`)                                                                  |
| `explain/` | Explain's lines: the engine's best line from a move that wasn't best, and the one punishing an error, each searched from its first move when Explain asks (`pumpLines`, `explainLines`)                                     |
| `view/`    | The DOM: the panel per mode (summary, moves, closed, live), the graph, the eval bar, the badge and arrows on the board, the move list's badges, the opening's name, the coach's avatar, the typing, the tooltip, the clicks |

Once every move is judged at full depth, the summary's counts are buttons:
one goes to the player's next move of its class after the one on the board,
round to the first again (`view/class-jump.ts`).

Explain swaps the coach's comment for a book move's opening, or for the
engine's lines around a move that wasn't best (`view/explain-hint.ts`); its
button plays the best line on the board as a variation, while the coach still
speaks of the move it stands for (`lineShown`, `view/navigation.ts`).

The game's analysis runs on the page's engines (`engine-pool.ts`): up to
three, on one thread each, as the device's cores and memory allow, each on a
position of its own (`nextJob`), on Lichess's relaxed SIMD build where the
browser runs it (`engine/relaxed-simd.ts`), a quarter faster. A position whose
engine stops answering goes to another, and once the analysis is complete all
engines but one are ended (a review read whole from the cache boots only
one). It waits in a hidden tab and while "Learn from your
mistakes" runs (`game/wait.ts`). Its core (`game/analyse-records.ts`) needs
only the game's id, positions and variant (`RecordsRun`, `game/records.ts`):
the analysis page adds the export, the draft and the move on the board first
(`game/analyse-game.ts`); the game page, once the game is over, runs it at
full depth only and ends its engines when done. Its records are saved as they
come in (`cdc-review-progress:*`), then under the finished game's key
(`cdc-review:*`); an index (`cdc-review-index`) keeps the 200 games analysed
last, on either page, and drops the others (`game/cache.ts`).

The summary's "Learn from your mistakes" hands over to Lichess's own
exercise (`view/learn.ts`): it asks for the server analysis the exercise needs
through Lichess's hidden form, turns the exercise on and closes the review, as
it runs in Lichess's tools. Starting the move-by-move review turns it off
(`closeTools`). The button shows only when the exercise can start (the game
has a server analysis, or Lichess offers to make one: not for a game of 4
moves or fewer), with Lichess's own label.

`render.ts` runs every 150 ms: it draws the panel again only when what it
shows changes (`render-key.ts`), keeping the buttons and scroll positions a
redraw leaves as they were, then the board's marks.

## Tests

Besides each folder's unit tests, `golden/` drives the review through
scripts of steps on a fake analysis page (`fixtures/review-script.ts`,
`fixtures/review-scenarios.ts`: a fake controller, move list and Stockfish,
fake timers) and checks that after each step it shows exactly what the
original script showed (`golden/fixtures/legacy-*.json`). One scenario per
test file: a started review can't be stopped, so each needs its own window.
